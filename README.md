# Introduction to R Statistical Analysis Software

This is the home repository for the R-review class for incoming Ph.D. students in 2023

## Syllabus

* You can find the Syllabus here in [PDF](https://github.com/lfr00154/R-review2023/blob/8ba9ba6d2108ba6c7db39e7d1df0fbe95722aacc/syllabus/syllabus.pdf) format. 
* You are free to use this [tex](https://github.com/lfr00154/R-review2023/blob/8ba9ba6d2108ba6c7db39e7d1df0fbe95722aacc/syllabus/syllabus.tex) file as a LaTex template for yourself to learn more about LaTex.

## Data

In this class, we will mostly use the public dataset, and I will either send the data to you through email or I will guide you to download the data during the lecture. 

## Code

In this class, I will provide you with an R-script file with Skeleton Code for you to start. And I will also provide an R-markdown file provided with a more detailed explanation. 

- `R script` is the place for you to play with the code.
- `R markdown` and the rendered `html` file are the study guides.
  - Note: You need to `Knit` the `Rmd` file to re-render the `html` file to open on your own browser: Use Chrome. Don't use Safari. 

## Other Materials

* We will not use slides very often except the first lecture. If we use a slide, it is just for transition.

* For the rest of the class, our class notes will be provided using `R markdown`, which can be found in this repository and also on Canvas.

* The lectures will be recorded, and the videos will be shared on YouTube with an unlisted link.

## Lecture Structure

The following is a tentative lecture structure, and I might adjust it based on the teaching progress:
