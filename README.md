# Introduction to R Statistical Analysis Software

This is the home repository for the R-review class for incoming Ph.D. students in 2023

## Syllabus

* You can find the Syllabus here in [PDF](https://github.com/lfr00154/R-review2023/blob/8ba9ba6d2108ba6c7db39e7d1df0fbe95722aacc/syllabus/syllabus.pdf) format. 
* You are free to use this [tex](https://github.com/lfr00154/R-review2023/blob/8ba9ba6d2108ba6c7db39e7d1df0fbe95722aacc/syllabus/syllabus.tex) file as a LaTex template for yourself to learn more about LaTex.

## Data

In this class, we will mostly use the public dataset, and I will either send the data to you through email or I will guide you to download the data during the lecture. 

## Code

In this class, I will provide you with an R-script file with Skeleton Code for you to start. And I will also provide an R-markdown file provided with a more detailed explanation. The Quarto-Markdown file (.qmd) file can be found in my github.io repository (here). 

## Other Materials

* In the first lecture, we will go over some tools I found helpful for you to start your Ph.D. career. The slide for half of the first lecture will be provided using LaTex-Beamer. You can also feel free to take it for your own use in the future.

* For the rest of the class, our class notes will be provided using R markdown, which can be found in this repository and also on my website.

* Slides will only be used for transition. Notes contain all the important information. 

* Based on your response, the lectures will or will not be recorded, and the videos will be shared on YouTube with an unlisted link.
