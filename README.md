# Introduction to R Statistical Analysis Software

This is the home repository for the R-review class for incoming PhD students in 2023

## Syllabus

* You can find the Syllabus here is in [PDF](https://github.com/lfr00154/R-review2023/blob/main/syllabus.pdf) format. 
* You are free to use this [tex](https://github.com/lfr00154/R-review2023/blob/main/syllabus.tex) file as a LaTex template for yourself to learn more about LaTex.

## Data

In this class, we will mostly use the public dataset and I will either send the data to you though email or I will guide you to download the data during the lecture. 

## Code

In this class, I will provide you a R-script file with Skeleton Code for you to start. And I will also provide a R-markdown file provided with more detailed explanation. The Quarto-Markdown file (.qmd) file can be find in my github.io repository (here). 

## Other Materials

* In the first lecture, we will go over some tools I found useful for you to start the PhD career. The slide for the half of the first lecture will be provided using LaTex-Beamer. You can also feel free to take it for your own use in the future.

* For the rest of the class, our class notes will be provided using revealjs, which can be found in this repository and also on my website. 

* My lectures will be recorded and the videos will be shared on YouTube with an unlisted link.
